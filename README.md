FIT3179 Data Visualisation Test 1
Sample Questions Below are questions from tests of previous years. Test 1 of this year will not include questions consisting of text only, such as the first three questions below. However, these questions are still useful to understand the tested knowledge. Some sample questions are multiple choice questions. Test 1 of this year will onlyinclude questions with a single correct answer.The sample questions mainly focus on marks, channels, dataset types, attribute types and  simple table idioms. However, you should also expect questions about data-ink ratio, chart junk, lying visualisation, storytelling, colour, visual hierarchy, typography, layout, as well as  advanced idioms for table datasets, and idioms for networks and trees. Answers to the sample questions can be found at the end of this document. General concepts

In visualisation design, “the most important attributes should be encoded with the most effective visual channels in order to be most noticeable, and then decreasingly important attributes can be matched with less effective channels” (unit textbook by Tamara Munzner, 2014, p 101). Suppose that we use a scatter plot (or bubble chart) to visualise the covid-19 dataset below. Each point represents a country; the colour hue is used to represent “Continent”.     The importance ranks of the attributes that we would like to visualise are: “Active (cases)” > “Deaths” > “Confirmed (cases)”. Which of the following visualisation designs is the most effective? A) Use x-axis to represent “Active cases”, y-axis to represent “Confirmed cases”, size (area) to represent “Deaths” B) Use x-axis to represent “Confirmed cases”, y-axis to represent “Active cases”, size (area) to represent “Deaths” C) Use x-axis to represent “Confirmed cases”, y-axis to represent “Deaths”, size (area) to represent “Active cases” D) Use x-axis to represent “Active cases”, y-axis to represent “Deaths”, size (area) to represent “Confirmed cases” Idiom vs attribute types The table below presents ten rows of a Victorian real estate dataset. The attributes include: 1) latitude 2) longitude 3) price of the property
type: house, apartment, townhouse, unit, etc. 5) bedroom: 1, 2, 3代 写FIT3179 Data VisualisationJava 代做程序编程语言, 4, or 5+   (“5+” means 5 or more bedrooms)
